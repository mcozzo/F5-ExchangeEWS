# F5 iRule for Exchange access to EWS
Additional iRule to limit access based on IP to the Exchange EWS service. Only addresses listed in the Data Group are allowed access, otherwise return 404. 

## Steps
1. Create iRule and import code
2. Create iRule Data Group List *Local Traffic > iRules > Data Group List*
    2. Create a new list  
    Name: **Exchange_EWS_Allowed_IP**  
    Type: **Address**  
    3. Add addresses to the list using the following convention: [Address] := [Value]  
    For example: 
    ```
    10.0.0.0/8 := RFC1918-10
    172.16.0.0/12 := RFC1918-172
    192.168.0.0/16 := RFC1918-192
    x.x.x.x := ServiceName
    ```
3. Deploy iApp for exchange. 
    1. In the iApp config section select *Customize pool settings*
    2. Add the *Exchange_EWS_Allowed_IP* iRule
